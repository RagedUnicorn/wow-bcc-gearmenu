# Fixes

* Add missing ammo translation for zhCN (thanks to @T3rdW)
* Add failover path if migration to v2.0.0 does not work.
  * Affected players should delete the following file to start with a clean slate - `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\[account]\[server]\[character]\SavedVariables\GearMenu.lua`
